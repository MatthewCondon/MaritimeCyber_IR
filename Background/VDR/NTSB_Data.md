# National Transportation Security Board (NTSB)
The NTSB is responsible for posting previously collected and analyzed data from maritime incidents. The link for their website can be accessed at: https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/home.aspx

Depending on what is searched, most of the results will provide a PDF with findings and overall results from the incident. Searching "VDR CSV" will yield results with real VDR data to download and analyze. 

While not directly related to the scope of forensic analysis, this is a good starting point to determine what good data may look like before an apparent incident.
