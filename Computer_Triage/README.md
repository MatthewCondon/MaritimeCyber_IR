# Importance of Triage
Modern vessels depend on complex digital ecosystems—navigation suites, engineering control systems, communication networks, and administrative computers—all of which can generate critical evidence during a maritime incident. As a result, computer triage and analysis of electronic equipment has become a central component of maritime investigations, supporting accurate reconstruction, root-cause identification, and regulatory or legal conclusions.

A helpful way to visualize the investigative workflow is captured in the following cycle:

Beyond identifying evidence, triage guides the forensic strategy. Many maritime networks contain a mix of IT and OT systems, each with different risks and acquisition methods. A live ICS system controlling propulsion or steering cannot simply be imaged like a standard PC; investigators must evaluate the safety implications of pulling power or interfacing with controllers. Likewise, NMEA-2000 and CAN-bus devices often store data in volatile memory or proprietary buffer formats, requiring immediate capture using specialized gateways or direct bus sniffing. Early triage helps ensure the right tools—packet capture devices, write blockers, CAN-bus loggers, forensic imaging suites—are deployed appropriately.

Computer analysis also provides critical context during reconstruction of the incident. For example, correlating VDR audio with network logs, radar tracks, and engine-room control messages can reveal timing discrepancies, mechanical failures, incorrect inputs, spoofed navigation data, or signs of cyber manipulation. Deep analysis of PCs and servers may uncover email communications, malware activity, unauthorized remote access, or misconfigurations that contributed to the event. In regulatory or legal contexts, such findings support accurate attribution and improve safety recommendations.

# Traditional Approach
Computer triage is the rapid, first-phase assessment of a system to determine its evidentiary value, data volatility, and immediate risks of loss or alteration. During a maritime incident investigation, triage begins by documenting the computer’s physical state—power status, connected peripherals, visible damage, and the presence of any external devices such as USB drives, adapters, or dongles. Investigators should photograph all sides of the system, noting the condition and occupancy of USB ports, SD card slots, Ethernet interfaces, or serial connectors. USB devices can contain logs, malware, configuration files, or unauthorized data transfers, making their identification and preservation essential.
Next, investigators assess whether the system should remain powered on. If the device is running, volatile data such as RAM contents, active processes, and open files may need to be captured before shutdown. If powered off, it should not be turned on without proper forensic controls. Investigators also check for signs of tampering—loose screws, missing panels, broken seals, or unexpected hardware attachments.
Triage concludes by labeling and isolating the system, securing connected media, and determining the appropriate acquisition method (live capture, disk imaging, or peripheral extraction). Proper triage ensures evidence is preserved safely, consistently, and without contamination.
