When checking for anomalies, compare readings with actual sea state, observed wind, and nearby weather sources. Look for wind shifts that don’t match vessel motion, water temps that change too fast, or values that contradict other sensors. |
| 🟡 | 130311 | Environmental Parameters | Degrees C / Volts / Amps / Persent         | Provides environmental data such as air temperature, water temperature, and barometric pressure. When checking for anomalies, compare these values with ship logs, nearby sensors, and observed conditions. Look for sudden jumps, impossible temperatures, or pressure readings that don’t match the weather. |
| 🟡 | 130312 | Temperature              | Degrees C                                   | Provides temperature data from onboard sensors, typically including air, water, or engine-related temperatures depending on the source. When checking for anomalies, compare the reported values with ship logs, nearby sensors, and expected operating conditions. Look for temperatures that jump suddenly, stay fixed for long periods, or fall outside normal ranges. |
| 🟡 | 130313 | Humidity                 | Percent                                      | Provides the vessel’s current humidity level from onboard environmental sensors. When checking for anomalies, compare the reported humidity with local weather conditions, ship logs, and other environmental readings. Look for values that stay fixed, change too rapidly, or fall outside what would be expected for the area and weather. |
| 🟢 | 130314 | Actual Pressure          | Pascals                                      | Provides the vessel’s current barometric pressure as measured by onboard sensors. When checking for anomalies, compare the pressure reading with ship logs, nearby weather reports, and observed conditions. Look for sudden drops or spikes, values that don’t match the local weather pattern, or pressure that stays fixed despite changing conditions. |
| 🟢 | 130316 | Extended Temperature      | Degrees                                      | Provides extended temperature data from multiple sensors, often including additional engine rooms, machinery spaces, or specialized equipment zones. When checking for anomalies, compare each temperature source with expected operating conditions and nearby sensors. Look for readings that change too quickly, remain fixed, or fall far outside normal ranges for that location. |
| 🟢 | 130320 | Sea Temperature          | Degrees                                      | Provides the vessel’s seawater temperature as measured by the intake or hull-mounted sensor. When checking for anomalies, compare the reported sea temperature with charts, weather data, and nearby environmental sensors. Look for values that shift too quickly, stay fixed despite movement between water masses, or don’t match the region’s expected ocean temperature. |
| 🟢 | 130321 | Salinity                 | PSU                                          | Provides the vessel’s measured salinity level, typically from a seawater intake or environmental sensor. When checking for anomalies, compare the salinity reading with expected ocean conditions, charts, and nearby environmental sources. Look for values that change too fast, stay fixed despite crossing water boundaries, or fall well outside regional norms. |
| 🟢 | 130322 | Tide Station Data        | Meters / Seconds                             | Provides tide information from a connected tide station, including predicted tide height, tide trend, and reference timestamp. When checking for anomalies, compare the reported tide levels with official tide tables, local observations, and nearby sensors. Look for sudden jumps, tide heights that don’t match the forecast, or data that stays fixed through known tidal changes. |
| 🟢 | 130323 | Meteorological Station Data | °C / Percent / Meters/Second / Degrees     | Provides a full set of weather observations from a connected meteorological station, including wind, temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, and precipitation data. When checking for anomalies compare the station’s readings with nearby sensors, shipboard logs, and expected local conditions. Look for sudden shifts that don’t match the vessel’s movement or environment, values that freeze in place, or data that contradicts other environmental PGNs. |
| 🟢 | 130324 | Weather Report           | °C / Pascals / Meters/Second / Degrees      | Provides high-rate latitude and longitude updates from the vessel’s navigation receiver. This PGN delivers only position—no time, no quality indicators—intended for fast plotting and steering systems. When checking for anomalies, compare the rapid-update position against the slower, full GNSS position PGNs. Look for sudden jumps, drifting while the vessel is anchored, frozen coordinates, or positions that disagree with charted landmasses. |
| 🟡 | 130577 | Direction Data           | Degrees                                      | Provides the vessel’s compass-based direction information, typically including heading, magnetic variation, and reference type (magnetic or true). Used by autopilots, chartplotters, and steering systems to maintain proper course alignment. When checking for anomalies, compare heading with COG from GNSS and the ship’s known orientation. Look for sudden heading flips, frozen values, variation that doesn’t match the region, or data that contradicts gyro or satellite compass inputs. |
