When working with NMEA 2000 data, there are three formats that may be collected.

## Raw SocketCAN
```

```

## Compact Human-Readable
```
can0  09F8012B   [8]  FF FF FF 7F FF FF FF 7F

# Converting Data Formats
The relevant conversions for an investigation are shown below.

## Raw SocketCAN > CSV
```
candump2analyzer < CAN.log > CSV.log
```
_This command has no output associated with it._

## Compact Human-Readable > Raw SocketCAN
This must be transformed during the collection process.
